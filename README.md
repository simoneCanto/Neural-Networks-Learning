In this exercise, you will implement the backpropagation algorithm for neural networks and apply it to the task of hand-written digit recognition. Before starting on the programming exercise, we strongly recommend watching the video lectures and completing the review questions for the associated topics.

To get started with the exercise, you will need to download the starter code and unzip its contents to the directory where you wish to complete the exercise. If needed, use the cd command in Octave/MATLAB to change to this directory before starting this exercise.

You can also find instructions for installing Octave/MATLAB in the \Environment Setup Instructions" of the course website. Files included in this exercise ex4.m - Octave/MATLAB script that steps you through the exercise ex4data1.mat - Training set of hand-written digits ex4weights.mat - Neural network parameters for exercise 4 submit.m - Submission script that sends your solutions to our servers displayData.m - Function to help visualize the dataset fmincg.m - Function minimization routine (similar to fminunc) sigmoid.m - Sigmoid function computeNumericalGradient.m - Numerically compute gradients checkNNGradients.m - Function to help check your gradients debugInitializeWeights.m - Function for initializing weights
predict.m - Neural network prediction function

1.sigmoidGradient.m - Compute the gradient of the sigmoid function

2.randInitializeWeights.m - Randomly initialize weights

3.nnCostFunction.m - Neural network cost function

4.indicates files you will need to complete

Throughout the exercise, you will be using the script ex4.m. These scripts set up the dataset for the problems and make calls to functions that you will write. You do not need to modify the script. You are only required to modify functions in other files, by following the instructions in this assignment.
